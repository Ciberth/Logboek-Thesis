# Questions

## Survey

Who is filling in:
- Developer
- Data scientist
- Operations engineer
- Business or project management
- Other (specify)

Option for multiple but with the request to choose the most fitting answer (and with whose eyes they are looking/answeering the questions) OR option for 1 and make a roadmap through the questions.

For developers, data scientists, business (and pm), other:
- Have you encountered the problem (versioning, configuring things and lose of time or problems)
- Have you ever felt the need to have a tool for your infrastructure which you didn't have
- Familiarity with CM tools, juju, terraform...
- Would you use a modelling tool such as described
- Do you think it would reduce work load
- Do you think it would help on other areas (such as business, PM, documentation)
- Do you think these tools (virtual administrators) can replace real life operation engineers
- Do you outsource/think outsorcing is better then using these tools
- Is this the next step in CM/IaC

For operations engineers:
- Familiarity with juju, CM, why you use, why you don't use it
- Do you think these tools offer enough flexibility as if you would use and configure everything manually
- Do you feel the need for (gui like) modelling techniques on top of the existing frameworks
-
